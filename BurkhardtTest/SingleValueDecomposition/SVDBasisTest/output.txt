SVD_BASIS: (C++ version)

  Compiled on Jun 24 2005 at 08:22:58.

  Given a PDE for which:
    C is the number of components of the solution
      at any single point,
    P is the number of points where a solution is given,
    N is the number of solution vectors,
    L is the number of modes to be extracted.

  Then we let M = C*P be the abstract spatial dimension.

  Set up A, the M by N matrix of solution vectors,

  Get A = U * S * V', the singular value decomposition.

  The first L columns of U are our modes.

  How many basis vectors (L) are to be extracted?

  L = 4

  You specify a consecutive sequence of file names
  by giving the first "base" file name.

  If there are no more sequences to enter,
  just hit RETURN.

  Enter a new base file name, or RETURN:

1:  "data01.txt"

  According to the first base file,
  The number of solution components C =   3
  The number of solution points P =       4
  The "size" of each solution M = (C*P) = 12

  You specify a consecutive sequence of file names
  by giving the first "base" file name.

  If there are no more sequences to enter,
  just hit RETURN.

  Enter a new base file name, or RETURN:

  RETURN was entered.
  Presumably, there are no more file sequences.

  The number of data files N = 5

  The data is stored in an M by N matrix A.

  The "spatial" dimension M is 12
  The number of data points N is 5

  The data has been read into the matrix A.

SINGULAR_VECTORS
  For an MxN matrix A in general storage,
  The LINPACK routine DSVDC computes the
  singular value decomposition:

    A = U * S * V'


  The leading singular values:

     1           75.7027
     2           11.1519
     3            7.5139
     4           2.64009

SVD_BASIS:
  Ready to write the left singular vectors to files.

  Do you want comments in the header of the file?
  (These begin with the "#" character.) (Y/N)

  Enter "Y" or "N":

  Writing first file svd_001.txt
  Writing last file  svd_004.txt

SVD_BASIS:
  Normal end of execution.
