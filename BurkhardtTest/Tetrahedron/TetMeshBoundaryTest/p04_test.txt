TET_MESH_BOUNDARY
  C++ version
  Read files defining a tet mesh dataset.

  Determine the faces that form the boundary;
  write a boundary node mask file;
  write a boundary node file;
  write a boundary element file,
  defining the boundary as a TRI_SURFACE.

  Read the header of "p04_nodes.txt".

  Spatial dimension = 3
  Number of nodes   = 587

  Read the data in "p04_nodes.txt".

  First 5 nodes:

  Read the header of "p04_elements.txt".

  Element order = 4
  Number of tetras  = 2775

  Read the data in "p04_elements.txt".

  First 5 elements:

  Row:      1       2       3       4  
  Col

    1     460     522     459     514

    5     410     482     400     474  

MESH_BASE_ZERO:
  The element indexing appears to be 1-based.
  This will be converted to 0-based.

  Number of faces is 11100
  Number of boundary faces is 490
  Number of boundary nodes is 247

  Wrote the boundary node coordinates to "p04_boundary_nodes.txt".
  Wrote the boundary node mask to "p04_boundary_node_mask.txt".
  Wrote the boundary face coordinates to "p04_boundary_elements.txt".

TET_MESH_BOUNDARY:
  Normal end of execution.
