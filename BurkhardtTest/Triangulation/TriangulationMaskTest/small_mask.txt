TRIANGULATION_MASK
  C++ version:

  Read a node file of NODE_NUM points in 2 dimensions.
  Read an associated triangulation file of TRIANGLE_NUM
  triangles using 3 or 6 nodes.

  For each triangle, call a user masking routine
  to see if the triangle should be MASKED (not shown).

  Write new node and triangulation files corresponding
  to the unmasked data only.

  The element indexing appears to be 1-based!
  This will be converted to 0-based.
