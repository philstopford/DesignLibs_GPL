        // 
        //  Purpose:
        //
        //    MARRIAGE finds a stable set of marriages for given preferences.
        // 
        //  Discussion:
        // 
        //    Given a set of N men and N women who must be married in pairs,
        //    and information defining the relative rankings that each person
        //    assigns to the candidates of the opposite sex, this routine finds
        //    a stable set of marriages for them.
        // 
        //    A stable set of marriages is a pairing of the men and women with
        //    the stability property: if M1 marries W1 and M2 marries W2, then
        //    it is never the case that M1 and W2 would both prefer to be married
        //    to each other.
        // 
        //    An important application of stable marriage algorithms occurs in
        //    the annual matching of medical residents to hospitals.

        //  Parameters:
        // 
        //    Input, int N, the number of pairs of men and women.
        // 
        //    Input, int PREFER[N*N]; for man I, the value of
        //    PREFER(I,J) represents his J-th preference for a wife.
        // 
        //    Input, int RANK[N*N]; for woman I, the value of RANK(I,J)
        //    represents her ranking of man number J.  A value of 1 for RANK(I,J)
        //    means woman I ranks man J most preferable, while a value of N
        //    would mean she ranked him least preferable.
        // 
        //    Output, int FIANCEE[N]; for woman I, FIANCEE(I) is the
        //    man to whom she is now engaged.
        // 
        //    Output, int NEXT[N]; for man I, NEXT(I) is his preference
        //    ranking for the woman to whom he is now engaged.  A value of 1 represents
        //    his first choice, a value of N his last.
