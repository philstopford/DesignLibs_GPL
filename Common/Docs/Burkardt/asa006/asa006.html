      ASA006 - Cholesky Factor of a Positive Definite Symmetric Matrix

      ASA006 <br> Cholesky Factor of a Positive Definite Symmetric Matrix
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>ASA006</b>
      is which
      computes the Cholesky factor of a positive definite symmetric matrix.
    </p>

    <p>
      ASA006 is Applied Statistics Algorithm 6.  Source code for many
      Applied Statistics Algorithms is available through
      <a href = "http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/apstat">STATLIB</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If <b>A</b> is a positive definite symmetric matrix, then there is an
      upper triangular matrix <b>U</b> with the property that
      <blockquote><b>
        A = U' * U
      </b></blockquote>
      The matrix <b>U</b> is known as the <i>Cholesky factor</i> of <b>A</b>,
      and can be used to easily solve linear systems involving <b>A</b>
      or compute the inverse of <b>A</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The algorithm implemented here uses a compressed storage for both the
      matrix <b>A</b> and the factor <b>U</b>.  This saves some storage, but
      can make computations a little awkward.
