    <p>
      <b>ASA007</b>
      is which
      computes the inverse of a symmetric positive definite matrix,
      by Michael Healy.
    </p>

    <p>
      ASA007 is Applied Statistics Algorithm 7.  Source code for many
      Applied Statistics Algorithms is available through
      <a href = "http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/apstat">STATLIB</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The algorithm implemented here uses a compressed storage for both the
      matrix <b>A</b> and the factor <b>U</b>.  This saves some storage, but
      can make computations a little awkward.
