      ASA144 <br> Random generation of a table.
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>ASA144</b>
      is which
      randomly generates an RxC contingency table,
      by James Boyett.
    </p>

    <p>
      ASA144 is Applied Statistics Algorithm 144.  Source code for many
      Applied Statistics Algorithms is available through
      <a href = "http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/apstat">STATLIB</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      ASA144 accepts a table shape (the number of rows and columns),
      and two vectors, the lists of row and column sums.  There may be 0, 1, or
      many tables with nonnegative, integral entries that have the given
      shape and sums.  The program will generate, at random, one of the
      tables and return it.  Repeated calls to the program will return
      new random selections.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, suppose M = 2, N = 3, row sum = (/ 6, 5 /) and
      column sum = (/ 3, 4, 4 /), then here are two tables that satisfy
      the constraints:
      <pre>
        1  2  3
        2  2  1
      </pre>
      and
      <pre>
        3  0  3
        0  4  1
      </pre>
    </p>
