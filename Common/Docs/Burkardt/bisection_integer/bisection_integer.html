      BISECTION_INTEGER <br> Seek Integer Roots for F(X)=0

    <p>
      <b>BISECTION_INTEGER</b>
      is which
      seeks an integer solution to the equation F(X)=0,
      using bisection within a user-supplied change of sign interval [A,B].
    </p>

    <p>
      A function F(X) confined to integer arguments is given, with an
      interval [A,B] over which F changes sign.  An integer C is sought
      such that A &leq; C &leq; B and F(C) = 0.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because we are restricted to integer arguments, it may the case that
      there is no such C.
    </p>

    <p>
      This routine proceeds by a form of bisection, in which the enclosing
      interval is restricted to be defined by integer values.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the user has given a true change of sign interval [A,B], and if,
      in the interval, there is a single integer value C for which F(C) = 0,
      with the additional restrictions that F(C-1) and F(C+1) are of opposite
      signs, then this procedure should locate and return C.
    </p>

    <p>
      In particular, if the function F is monotone, and there is an integer
      solution C in the interval, then this procedure will find it.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, in general, even if there is an integer C in the interval,
      such that F(C) = 0, this procedure may be unable to find it, particularly
      if there are also nonintegral solutions within the same interval.
    </p>

    <p>
      While any integer function can be used with this program, the bisection
      approach is most useful if the integer function is monotone, or
      varies slowly, or can be regarded as the restriction to integer arguments
      of a continuous (and smoothly varying) function of a real argument.
      In such cases, knowing that F is negative at A and positive at B
      suggests that F generally increases from A to B, and might attain 
      the value 0 at some intermediate argument C.
