    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>BISECTION_RC</b>
      is which
      demonstrates the simple bisection method for solving a scalar nonlinear
      equation in a change of sign interval, using reverse communication (RC).
    </p>

    <p>
      The routine assumes that an interval [a,b] is known, over which
      the function f(x) is continuous, and for which f(a)
      and f(b) are of opposite sign.  By repeatedly computing and testing
      the midpoint, the halving change of sign interval may be reduced,
      so that either the uncertainty interval or the magnitude of the function value
      becomes small enough to satisfy the user as an approximation to the
      location of a root of the function.
    </p>

    <p>
      This routine is in part a demonstration of the idea of reverse communication.
      Many zero finders require that the user define f(x) by writing a function
      with a very specific set of input and output arguments, and sometimes with
      a specific name, so that the user can call the zero finder, which in turn
      can call the function.  This is sometimes an awkward formulation to follow.
      Reverse communication instead allows the user's calling program to retain
      control of the function evaluation.
    </p>

    <p>
      To use the reverse communication zero finder, the user defines the values
      of A and B, and sets a parameter JOB to zero to indicate that this is the
      first call.  From then on, the zero finder repeatedly returns a value X,
      asking the user to evaluate the function there.  Once the user has evaluated
      FX = f(X), the user may accept this approximation to the root, or else
      call the zero finder again, passing the just-computed value of FX so that it
      can take another bisection step.
