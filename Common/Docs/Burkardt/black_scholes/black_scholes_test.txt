BLACK_SCHOLES_PRB
  C++ version
  Test the BLACK_SCHOLES library.

ASSET_PATH_TEST:
  Demonstrate the simulated of an asset price path.

  The asset price at time 0      S0    = 2
  The asset expected growth rate MU    = 0.1
  The asset volatility           SIGMA = 0.3
  The expiry date                T1    = 1
  The number of time steps       N     = 100
  The random number seed was     SEED  = 123456789

  Partial results:

         0:              2
