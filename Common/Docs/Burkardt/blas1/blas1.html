      BLAS1 <br>
      The Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms <br>
      Level 1
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>BLAS1</b>
      is which
      implements the Level 1 Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS).
    </p>

    <p>
      The BLAS are a small core library of linear algebra utilities,
      which can be highly optimized for various architectures.  Software
      that relies on the BLAS is thus highly portable, and will typically
      run very efficiently.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Level 1 BLAS are primarily for use in vector operations, such
      as vector norms, dot products, vector scaling, and the addition of a 
      scalar multiple of one vector to another.
    </p>

    <p>
      While the entries of a typical vector are stored continguously in memory,
      many BLAS1 routines allow the user to specify a vector by locating
      its first element, and giving an increment to be used to locate the
      successive elements.  An increment of +1 corresponds to the typical vector;
      however, by specifying other increments, a "logical" vector can be
      selected that is actually a row, column, or even a diagonal of a two-dimensional
      array.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Level 1 BLAS are available in both real and complex arithmetic
      versions, and using single precision or double precision.  In most
      cases, a given BLAS function has a root name, such as <b>AXPY</b>,
      and prefix is used to identify the arithmetic and precision.  Thus,
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>CAXPY</b> is the single precision complex version of AXPY;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>DAXPY</b> is the double precision real version of AXPY;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>SAXPY</b> is the single precision real version of AXPY;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ZAXPY</b> is the double precision complex version of AXPY;
        </li>
      </ul>
