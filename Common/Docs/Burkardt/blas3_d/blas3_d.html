      BLAS3_D <br> 
      Double Precisionn Real Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms - Level 3
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>BLAS3_D</b>
      is which
      implements the Level 3 BLAS, or Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms,
      using double precision real arithmetic.
    </p>

    <p>
      The BLAS are a small core library of linear algebra utilities,
      which can be highly optimized for various architectures.  Software
      that relies on the BLAS is thus highly portable, and will typically
      run very efficiently.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Level 3 BLAS are primarily for use in matrix-matrix operations,
      such as matrix multiplication.
      In certain cases, they may also be used to operate on the rows
      or columns of a two-dimensional array.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Level 3 BLAS were originally written in FORTRAN77.  This version
      of the library only contains a subset of the BLAS3 library (at
      the moment, mainly just DGEMM and SGEMM).  Arrays are stored according to the
      FORTRAN convention.  Thus, an M by N mathematical array might be stored 
      in a double precision FORTRAN array called "A" that is declared as 
      <pre>
        double precision a(lda,sda)
      </pre>
      where LDA is the "leading" dimension and SDA is the "second" dimension.
      It is natural for LDA to equal M, but it is only necessary that 
      M <= LDA.  The matrix is stored as a vector of concatenated column 
      vectors, and the dimension statement is used to determine that columns 
      should be LDA units long.  Thus, a typical entry A(I,J) of the 
      mathematical matrix is actually stored in the location FORTRAN
      vector location I+(J-1)*LDA.  Of course, in C, this location would be
      I-1+(J-1)*LDA.
