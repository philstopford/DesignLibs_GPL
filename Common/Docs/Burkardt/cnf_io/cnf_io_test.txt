CNF_IO_PRB
  C++ version
  Test the CNF_IO library.

TEST01
  CNF_WRITE can write CNF data to a CNF file.

  Here is the data:

CNF data printout:

  The number of variables       V_NUM  = 3
  The number of clauses         C_NUM  = 2
  The number of signed literals L_NUM  = 5

  Clause 0 includes 2 signed literals:
   1
  -3

  Clause 1 includes 3 signed literals:
   2
   3
  -1

  Now we call CNF_WRITE to store this information
  in the file "cnf_io_v3_c2.cnf".

TEST02
  CNF_HEADER_READ reads the header of a CNF file.

  Read the header of "cnf_io_v3_c2.cnf".

  The number of variables       V_NUM  = 3
  The number of clauses         C_NUM  = 2
  The number of signed literals L_NUM  = 5

TEST03
  CNF_DATA_READ reads the data of a CNF file.

  Read the header of "cnf_io_v3_c2.cnf".

  The number of variables       V_NUM  = 3
  The number of clauses         C_NUM  = 2
  The number of signed literals L_NUM  = 5

  Here is the data as read from the file:

CNF data printout:

  The number of variables       V_NUM  = 3
  The number of clauses         C_NUM  = 2
  The number of signed literals L_NUM  = 5

  Clause 0 includes 2 signed literals:
   1
  -3

  Clause 1 includes 3 signed literals:
   2
   3
  -1

TEST04
  CNF_WRITE can write CNF data to a CNF file.

  Here is the data to be written to the file:

CNF data printout:

  The number of variables       V_NUM  = 16
  The number of clauses         C_NUM  = 18
  The number of signed literals L_NUM  = 36

  Clause 0 includes 2 signed literals:
   1
   2

  Clause 1 includes 2 signed literals:
  -2
  -4

  Clause 2 includes 2 signed literals:

  Clause 15 includes 2 signed literals:
  13
  14

  Clause 16 includes 2 signed literals:
  14
 -15

  Clause 17 includes 2 signed literals:
  15
  16

  Now we call CNF_WRITE to store this information
  in the file "cnf_io_v16_c18.cnf".

TEST05
  CNF_HEADER_READ reads the header of a CNF file.

  Read the header of "cnf_io_v16_c18.cnf".

  The number of variables       V_NUM  = 16
  The number of clauses         C_NUM  = 18
  The number of signed literals L_NUM  = 36

TEST06
  CNF_DATA_READ reads the data of a CNF file.

  Read the header of "cnf_io_v16_c18.cnf".

  The number of variables       V_NUM  = 16
  The number of clauses         C_NUM  = 18
  The number of signed literals L_NUM  = 36

  Here is the data as read from the file:
