//****************************************************************************80
//
//  Purpose:
//
//    MAIN is the main program for CVT_DATASET.
//
//  Discussion:
//
//    CVT_DATASET computes a centroidal Voronoi Tessellation dataset.
//
//    This program is meant to be used interactively.  It's also
//    possible to prepare a simple input file beforehand and use it
//    in batch mode.
//
//    The program requests input values from the user:
//
//    * DIM_NUM, the spatial dimension,
//    * N, the number of points to generate,
//    * SEED, a seed to use for random number generation;
//    * INIT, initialize the points:
//      ** file, by reading data from file;
//      ** GRID, picking points from a grid;
//      ** HALTON, from a Halton sequence;
//      ** RANDOM, using C++ RANDOM function;
//      ** UNIFORM, using a simple uniform RNG;
//      ** USER, call the "user" routine;
//    * IT_MAX, the maximum number of iterations;
//    * IT_FIXED, the number of iterative steps to take
//      using a fixed set of sampling points.
//    * SAMPLE, how to conduct the sampling:
//      ** GRID, picking points from a grid;
//      ** HALTON, from a Halton sequence;
//      ** RANDOM, using C++ RANDOM function;
//      ** UNIFORM, using a simple uniform RNG;
//      ** USER, call the "user" routine;
//    * SAMPLE_NUM, the number of sampling points;
//    * BATCH, the number of sampling points to create at one time;
//    * OUTPUT, a file in which to store the data;
//
//    To indicate that no further computations are desired, it is 
//    enough to input a nonsensical value, such as -1.
