CVT_DATASET (C++ version)
  Generate a CVT dataset.

  Compiled on Nov 17 2004 at 14:20:19

  This program is meant to be used interactively.
  It is also possible to prepare a simple input
  file beforehand and use it in batch mode.

  The program requests input values from the user:

  * NDIM, the spatial dimension,
  * N, the number of points to generate,
  * SEED, a seed to use for random number generation,
  * INIT, initialize the points:
    ** file, read data from a file;
    ** GRID, by picking points from a grid;
    ** HALTON, from a Halton sequence;
    ** RANDOM, using FORTRAN RANDOM function;
    ** UNIFORM, using a simple uniform RNG;
  * IT_MAX, the maximum number of iterations.
  * IT_FIXED, the number of iterative steps to take
    using a fixed set of sampling points.
  * SAMPLE, how to conduct the sampling.
    ** GRID, by picking points from a grid;
    ** HALTON, from a Halton sequence;
    ** RANDOM, using FORTRAN RANDOM function;
    ** UNIFORM, using a simple uniform RNG;
  * SAMPLE_NUM, the number of sample points.
  * BATCH, the number of sample points to generate at one time.
  * OUTPUT, a file to store the data.

  To indicate that no further computations are
  desired, it is enough to input a nonsensical value,
  such as -1.

  Enter NDIM, the spatial dimension:
  (Try '2' if you have no preference.)
  (0 or any negative value terminates execution).
  User input NDIM = 2

  Enter N, the number of points to generate:
  (Try '25' if you have no preference.)
  (0 or any negative value terminates execution).
  User input N = 85

  Enter SEED, a seed for the random number generator:
  (Try '123456789' if you have no preference.)
  (Any negative value terminates execution).
  User input SEED = 123456789

  INIT is the method of initializing the data:

  file     read data from a file;
  GRID     by picking points from a grid;
  HALTON   from a Halton sequence;
  RANDOM   using C++ RANDOM function;
  UNIFORM  using a simple uniform RNG;

  (Try 'RANDOM' if you have no preference.)
  (A blank value terminates execution).

  Enter INIT:
  User input INIT = "uniform".

  IT_MAX is the maximum number of iterations.

  An iteration carries out the following steps:
  * the Voronoi region associated with each
    generator is estimated by sampling;
  * the centroid of each Voronoi region is estimated.
  * the generator is replaced by the centroid.

  If "enough" sampling points are used,
  and "enough" iterations are taken, this process
  will converge.

  (Try '50' if you have no preference.)
  (A negative value terminates execution).

  Enter IT_MAX:
  User input IT_MAX = 40

  IT_FIXED is the number of consecutive iterations
  to take with a fixed set of sample points.

  Setting IT_FIXED to 1 means a new set of sample
  points is generated on every iterative step;
  Setting IT_FIXED equal to IT_MAX means a single set
  of sample points is used for the entire iteration.

  Any value between 1 and IT_MAX is reasonable.

  (Try 40 if you have no preference.)
  (A 0 or negative value terminates execution).

  Enter IT_FIXED:
  User input IT_FIXED = 1

  SAMPLE is the method of sampling the region:

  GRID     by picking points from a grid;
  HALTON   from a Halton sequence;
  RANDOM   using C++ RANDOM function;
  UNIFORM  using a simple uniform RNG;

  (Try 'RANDOM' if you have no preference.)
  (A blank value terminates execution).

  Enter SAMPLE:
  User input SAMPLE = "uniform".

  SAMPLE_NUM is the number of sample points.

  The Voronoi regions will be explored by generating
  SAMPLE_NUM points.  For each sample point, the
  nearest generator is found.  Using more points
  gives a better estimate of these regions.

  SAMPLE_NUM should be much larger than N, the
  number of generators.

  (Try '10000' if you have no preference.)
  (A zero or negative value terminates execution.)

  Enter SAMPLE_NUM:
  User input SAMPLE_NUM = 10000

  BATCH is the number of sample points to create at one time.

  BATCH should be between 1 and SAMPLE_NUM.

  It is FASTER to set BATCH to SAMPLE_NUM;
  setting BATCH to 1 requires the least memory.

  (Try 1000 if you have no preference.)
  (A zero or negative value terminates execution.)

  Enter BATCH:
  User input BATCH = 1000

  OUTPUT is a file in which to store the data.

  (Try 'cvt.txt' if you have no preference.)
  (A blank value terminates execution).

  Enter OUTPUT:
  User input OUTPUT = "cvt01.txt".

  Enter NDIM, the spatial dimension:
  (Try '2' if you have no preference.)
  (0 or any negative value terminates execution).
  User input NDIM = -1

CVT_DATASET
  The input value of NDIM = -1
  is interpreted as a request for termination.
  Normal end of execution.
