    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>ELLIPSE_GRID</b>
      is which
      generates a grid of points 
      over the interior of an ellipse in 2D.
    </p>

    <p>
      The library allows the user to define an ellipse by
      choosing its center and the length of its major and minor axes.  
      The user also choose N, the number of subintervals into which the 
      minor radius will be subdivided.  It then returns the gridpoints 
      defined by that choice.
