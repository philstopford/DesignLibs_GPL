FD1D_ADVECTION_DIFFUSION_STEADY:
  C++ version

  Solve the 1D steady advection diffusion equation:,
    v du/dx - k d2u/dx2 = 0
  with constant, positive velocity V and diffusivity K
  over the interval:
    0.0 <= x <= 1.0
  with boundary conditions:
    u(0) = 0, u(1) = 1.

  Use finite differences
   d u/dx  = (u(t,x+dx)-u(t,x-dx))/2/dx
   d2u/dx2 = (u(x+dx)-2u(x)+u(x-dx))/dx^2

  Diffusivity K = 0.05
  Velocity V    = 1
  Number of nodes NX = 101
  DX = 0.01
  Maximum safe DX is 0.1
