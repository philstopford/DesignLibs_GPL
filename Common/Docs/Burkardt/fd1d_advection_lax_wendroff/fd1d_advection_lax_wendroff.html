      Lax-Wendroff Method

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FD1D_ADVECTION_LAX_WENDROFF</b> 
      is a C++ program which
      applies the finite difference method to solve the time-dependent
      advection equation ut = - c * ux in one spatial dimension, with
      a constant velocity, using the Lax-Wendroff method for the time derivative,
      writing graphics files for processing by gnuplot.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Lax-Wendroff method is a modification to the Lax method with improved accuracy.
    </p>

    <p>
      We solve the constant-velocity advection equation in 1D,
      <pre>
        du/dt = - c du/dx
      </pre>
      over the interval:
      <pre>
        0.0 <= x <= 1.0
      </pre>
      with periodic boundary conditions, and
      with a given initial condition
      <pre>
        u(0,x) = (10x-4)^2 (6-10x)^2 for 0.4 <= x <= 0.6
               = 0 elsewhere.
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      For our simple case, the advection velocity is constant
      in time and space.  Therefore, (given our periodic boundary conditions),
      the solution should simply move smoothly from left to right, returning
      on the left again.  While the Lax method produces an artificial smearing
      of the solution because of an artificial viscosity effect, this behavior
      is much reduced for the Lax-Wendroff method.
