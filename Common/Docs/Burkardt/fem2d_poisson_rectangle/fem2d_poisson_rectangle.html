      FEM2D_POISSON_RECTANGLE <br> Finite Element Solution of the 2D Poisson Equation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEM2D_POISSON_RECTANGLE</b>
      is a C++ program which
      solves the 2D Poisson equation using the
      finite element method.
    </p>

    <p>
      The computational region is a rectangle, with Dirichlet
      boundary conditions applied along the boundary, and the Poisson
      equation applied inside.  Thus, the state variable U(x,y) satisfies:
      <pre>
        - ( Uxx + Uyy ) = F(x,y)  in the box;
                 U(x,y) = G(x,y)  on the box boundary;
      </pre>
      For this program, the boundary condition function G(x,y) is
      identically zero.
    </p>

    <p>
      The computational region is first covered with an NX by NY
      rectangular array of points, creating (NX-1)*(NY-1) subrectangles.
      Each subrectangle is divided into two triangles, creating a total
      of 2*(NX-1)*(NY-1) geometric "elements".  Because quadratic basis
      functions are to be used, each triangle will be associated not only
      with the three corner nodes that defined it, but with three extra
      midside nodes.  If we include these additional nodes, there are
      now a total of (2*NX-1)*(2*NY-1) nodes in the region.
    </p>

    <p>
      We now assume that the unknown function U(x,y) can be represented
      as a linear combination of the basis functions associated with each
      node.  The value of U at the boundary nodes is obvious, so we
      concentrate on the NUNK interior nodes where U(x,y) is unknown.
      For each node I, we determine a basis function PHI(I)(x,y), and
      evaluate the following finite element integral:
      <pre>
        Integral ( Ux(x,y) * PHIx(I)(x,y) + Uy(x,y) * PHIy(I)(x,y) ) =
        Integral ( F(x,y) * PHI(I)(x,y)
      </pre>
      The set of all such equations yields a linear system for the
      coefficients of the representation of U.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program allows the user to supply two routines:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>RHS ( X, Y )</b> returns the right hand side F(x,y)
          of the Poisson equation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>EXACT ( X, Y, U, DUDX, DUDY )</b> returns
          the exact solution of the Poisson equation.  This routine is
          necessary so that error analysis
          can be performed, reporting the L2 and H1 seminorm errors
          between the true and computed solutions.  It is also used
          to evaluate the boundary conditions.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      There are a few variables that are easy to manipulate.  In particular,
      the user can change the variables NX and NY in the main program,
      to change the number of nodes and elements.  The variables (XL,YB)
      and (XR,YT) define the location of the lower left and upper right
      corners of the rectangular region, and these can also be changed
      in a single place in the main program.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program writes out a file containing an Encapsulated
      PostScript image of the nodes and elements, with numbers.
      For values of NX and NY over 10, the plot is too cluttered to
      read.  For lower values, however, it is
      a valuable map of what is going on in the geometry.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is also able to write out a file containing the
      solution value at every node.  This file may be used to create
      contour plots of the solution.
