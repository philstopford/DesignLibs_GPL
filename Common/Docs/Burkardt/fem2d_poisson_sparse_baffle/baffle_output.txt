  Compiled on Aug 19 2018 at 17:19:10.

  A finite element method solver for the Poisson problem
  in an arbitrary triangulated region in 2 dimensions,
  using sparse storage and an iterative solver.

  - DEL H(x,y) DEL U(x,y) + K(x,y) * U(x,y) = F(x,y) in the region

                                     U(x,y) = G(x,y) on the boundary.

  The finite element method is used,
  with triangular elements,
  which must be a 3 node linear triangle.
