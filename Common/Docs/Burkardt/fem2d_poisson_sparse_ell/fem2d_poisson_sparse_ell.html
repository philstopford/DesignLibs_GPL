    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEM2D_POISSON_SPARSE_ELL</b> is which
      sets up the geometry and data for a Poisson problem in an L-shaped region
      for solution by FEM2D_POISSON_SPARSE.
    </p>

    <p>
      This mesh, which uses 65 nodes, was created by starting with
      a crude mesh, and having it refined by TRIANGULATION_REFINE and renumbered by
      TRIANGULATION_RCM.
