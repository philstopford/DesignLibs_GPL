    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEYNMAN_KAC_3D</b> 
      is a program which 
      demonstrates the use of the Feynman-Kac algorithm 
      to solve Poisson's equation in a 3D ellipsoid by averaging
      stochastic paths to the boundary.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is intended as a simple demonstration of the method.
      The main purpose is to have a version that runs sequentially, so that
      it can be compared to versions which have been enhanced using parallel
      programming techniques.
