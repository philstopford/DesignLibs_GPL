INT_EXACTNESS_GEGENBAUER
  C++ version

  Investigate the polynomial exactness of a Gauss-Gegenbauer
  quadrature rule by integrating exponentially weighted
  monomials up to a given degree over the (-oo,+oo) interval.

INT_EXACTNESS_GEGENBAUER: User input:
  Quadrature rule X file = "gegen_o1_a0.5_x.txt".
  Quadrature rule W file = "gegen_o1_a0.5_w.txt".
  Quadrature rule R file = "gegen_o1_a0.5_r.txt".
  Maximum degree to check = 5
  Exponent of (1-x^2), ALPHA = 0.5

  Spatial dimension = 1
  Number of points  = 1

  The quadrature rule to be tested is
  a Gauss-Gegenbauer rule
  ORDER = 1
  ALPHA = 0.5

  Standard rule:
    Integral ( -1 <= x <= +1 ) (1-x^2)^alpha f(x) dx
    is to be approximated by
    sum ( 1 <= I <= ORDER ) w(i) * f(x(i)).

  Weights W:

  w[ 0] =        1.570796326794897

  Abscissas X:

  x[ 0] =                        0

  Region R:

  r[ 0] =                       -1
  r[ 1] =                        1

  A Gauss-Gegenbauer rule would be able to exactly
  integrate monomials up to and including degree = 1
