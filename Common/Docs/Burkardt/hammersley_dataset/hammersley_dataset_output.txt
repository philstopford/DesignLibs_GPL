HAMMERSLEY_DATASET (C++ version)
  Generate a Hammersley dataset.

  This program is meant to be used interactively.
  It is also possible to prepare a simple input
  file beforehand and use it in batch mode.

  The program requests input values from the user:

  * NDIM, the spatial dimension,
  * N, the number of points to generate,
  * STEP, the index of the first subsequence element.
  * SEED(1:NDIM),the sequence element corresponding to STEP = 0
  * LEAP(1:NDIM), the succesive jumps in the sequence.
  * BASE(1:NDIM), the bases, usually distinct primes
    or -N (to generate values like I/N).

  The program generates the data, writes it to the file

    hammersley_NDIM_N.txt

  where NDIM and N are the numeric values specified
  by the user, and then asks the user for more input.

  To indicate that no further computations are
  desired, it is enough to input a nonsensical value,
  such as -1.

  Enter NDIM, the spatial dimension:
  (Try '2' if you have no preference.)
  (0 or any negative value terminates execution).

  Enter N, the number of points to generate:
  (Try '25' if you have no preference.)
  (0 or any negative value terminates execution).

  Enter STEP, the index of the first subsequence element:
  (Try '0' or '1' if you have no preference.)
  (Any negative value terminates execution).

  Enter SEED(1:NDIM), the starting element index
  for each coordinate
  (Try '0 0 ... 0' if you have no preference.)
  (a negative value terminates execution.)
  User input:           1           0

  Enter LEAP(1:NDIM), the leaping multiplier
  for each coordinate
  (Try '1 1 ... 1' if you have no preference.)
  (another choice is any prime larger than all the bases).
  (any value of 0 or less terminates execution.)
  User input:           1           1

  Enter BASE(1:NDIM), the bases, usually distinct 
  primes, but any NEGATIVE base generates
  values I/BASE.  (Try '-N 2 3 5 7 11 ...' if you have no preference.)
  (any value of 0 or 1 terminates execution.)
  User input:         -10           2

  The data was written to the file "hammersley_2_20.txt".

HALHAM_NDIM_CHECK - Fatal error!
  NDIM < 0.  NDIM = -1

HAMMERSLEY_DATASET
  The input value of NDIM = -1
  is interpreted as a request for termination.
  Normal end of execution.
