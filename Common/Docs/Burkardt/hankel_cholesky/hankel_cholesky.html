    <p>
      <b>HANKEL_CHOLESKY</b>
      is which
      can compute the upper Cholesky factor
      of a positive definite (symmetric) Hankel matrix H, that is,
      H = R' * R.
    </p>

    <p>
      A Hankel matrix is a matrix which is constant along all antidiagonals.  
      A schematic of a 5x5 Hankel matrix would be:
      <pre>
        a  b  c  d  e
        b  c  d  e  f
        c  d  e  f  g
        d  e  f  g  h
        e  f  g  h  i
