      HANKEL_PDS <br> Cholesky Factors Generating Positive Definite Symmetric Hankel Matrices
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>HANKEL_PDS</b>
      is which
      can compute a lower triangular matrix L which is the Cholesky factor
      of a positive definite (symmetric) Hankel matrix H, that is,
      H = L * L'.
    </p>

    <p>
      A Hankel matrix is a matrix which is constant along all antidiagonals.  
      A schematic of a 5x5 Hankel matrix would be:
      <pre>
        a  b  c  d  e
        b  c  d  e  f
        c  d  e  f  g
        d  e  f  g  h
        e  f  g  h  i
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Let J represent the exchange matrix, formed by reverse the order
      of the columns of the identity matrix.
      If H is a Hankel matrix, then J*H and J*H are Toeplitz matrices,
      and similarly in the other direction.  Hence many algorithms
      that apply to one class can be easily adapted to the other.
