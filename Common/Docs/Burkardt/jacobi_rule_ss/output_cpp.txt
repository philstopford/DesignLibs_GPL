JACOBI_RULE
  C++ version

  Compiled on Jan 16 2008 at 08:48:29.

  Compute a Gauss-Jacobi quadrature rule for approximating

    Integral ( -1 <= x <= +1 ) (1-x)^ALPHA (1+x)^BETA f(x) dx

  of order ORDER.

  The user specifies ORDER, ALPHA, BETA, and OUTPUT.

  OUTPUT is:

  "C++" for printed C++ output;
  "F77" for printed Fortran77 output;
  "F90" for printed Fortran90 output;
  "MAT" for printed MATLAB output;

  or:

  "filename" to generate 3 files:

    filename_w.txt - the weight file
    filename_x.txt - the abscissa file.
    filename_r.txt - the region file.

  The requested order of the rule is = 4

  The requested value of ALPHA = -1.99811

  The requested value of BETA = -3.22452e-232

  OUTPUT option is "C++".

JACOBI_COMPUTE - Fatal error!
  -1.0 < ALPHA is required.
