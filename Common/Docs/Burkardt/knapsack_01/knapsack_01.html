    </h1>

    <p>
      <b>KNAPSACK_01</b>,
      which
      uses brute force to solve small versions of the 0/1 knapsack problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the 0/1 knapsack problem, we are given a knapsack with carrying
      capacity C, and a set of N items, with the I-th item having a weight
      of W(I).  We want to pack as much total weight as possible into the
      knapsack without exceeding the weight limit.  We do this by specifying
      which items we will not take (0) or take (1).
    </p>

    <p>
      This library uses a simple brute force or exhaustive search method,
      which is guaranteed to get the optimal solution, but which is not
      efficient for large values of N.
