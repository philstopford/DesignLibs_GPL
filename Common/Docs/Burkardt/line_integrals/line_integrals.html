    <p>
      <b>LINE_INTEGRALS</b>
      is which
      returns the exact value of the integral of any monomial
      along the length of the unit monomial in 1D.
    </p>

    <p>
      The length of the unit line in 1D is defined by
      <pre>
        0 <= x <= 1
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The integrands are all of the form
      <pre>
        f(x) = x^e
      </pre>
      where the exponent is a nonnegative integer.
