    <p>
      <b>LINPACK</b>
      is which
      solves systems of linear equations for a variety of matrix types and 
      storage modes, for real or complex arithmetic, and for single or 
      double precision, by Jack Dongarra, Jim Bunch, Cleve Moler, Pete Stewart.
    </p>

    <p>
      LINPACK has officially been superseded by the LAPACK library.  The LAPACK
      library uses more modern algorithms and code structure.  However,
      the LAPACK library can be extraordinarily complex; what is done
      in a single LINPACK routine may correspond to 10 or 20 utility
      routines in LAPACK.  This is fine if you treat LAPACK as a black
      box.  But if you wish to learn how the algorithm works, or
      to adapt it, or to convert the code to another language, this
      is a real drawback.  This is one reason I still keep a copy
      of LINPACK around.
    </p>

    <p>
      The LINPACK routines are available in both real and complex arithmetic
      versions, and using single precision or double precision.  In most
      cases, a given routine has a root name, such as <b>GEFA</b>,
      and a prefix is used to identify the arithmetic and precision.  Thus,
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>CGEFA</b> is the single precision complex version of GEFA;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>DGEFA</b> is the double precision real version of GEFA;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>SGEFA</b> is the single precision real version of GEFA;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ZGEFA</b> is the double precision complex version of GEFA;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Versions of <b>LINPACK</b> in various arithmetic precisions are available
      through <a href = "http://www.netlib.org/">the NETLIB web site</a>.
