      LORENZ_ODE <br> The Lorenz System
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>LORENZ_ODE</b>
      is a C++ program which
      approximates solutions to the Lorenz system,
      creating output files that can be displayed by Gnuplot.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Lorenz system, originally intended as a simplified model of
      atmospheric convection, has instead become a standard example of
      sensitive dependence on initial conditions; that is, tiny differences
      in the starting condition for the system rapidly become magnified.
      The system also exhibits what is known as the "Lorenz attractor",
      that is, the collection of trajectories for different starting points
      tends to approach a peculiar butterfly-shaped region.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Lorenz system includes three ordinary differential equations:
      <pre>
        dx/dt = sigma ( y - x )
        dy/dt = x ( rho - z ) - y
        dz/dt = xy - beta z
      </pre>
      where the parameters beta, rho and sigma are usually assumed to be
      positive.  The classic case uses the parameter values
      <pre>
        beta = 8 / 3
        rho = 28
        sigma - 10
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The initial conditions for this system are not often specified; rather,
      investigators simply note that the trajectories associated with two very
      close starting points will eventually separate.  However, simply to
      get started, we can suggest the following starting values at t=0:
      <pre>
        x = 8
        y = 1
        z = 1
      </pre>
    </p>
