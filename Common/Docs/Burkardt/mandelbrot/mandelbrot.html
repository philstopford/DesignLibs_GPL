    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MANDELBROT</b> 
      is a C++ program which
      generates an ASCII Portable Pixel Map (PPM) image of the Mandelbrot set.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Mandelbrot set is a set of points C in the complex plane with
      the property that the iteration 
      <pre>
        z(n+1) = z(n)^2 + c
      </pre>
      remains bounded.
    </p>

    <p>
      All the points in the Mandelbrot set are known to lie within the circle
      of radius 2 and center at the origin.
    </p>

    <p>
      To make a plot of the Mandelbrot set, one starts with a given point C
      and carries out the iteration for a fixed number of steps.  If the
      iterates never exceed 2 in magnitude, the point C is taken to be a member
      of the Mandelbrot set.
