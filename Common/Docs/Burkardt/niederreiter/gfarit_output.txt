  C++ version

  A program which computes a set of arithmetic
  tables, and writes them to a file.

  Tables will be created for fields of prime or prime power order
  Q between 2 and 50.

  GFTAB computing table for Q = 4  with characteristic P = 2.
  GFTAB computing table for Q = 8  with characteristic P = 2.
  GFTAB computing table for Q = 9  with characteristic P = 3.
  GFTAB computing table for Q = 16  with characteristic P = 2.
  GFTAB computing table for Q = 25  with characteristic P = 5.
  GFTAB computing table for Q = 27  with characteristic P = 3.
  GFTAB computing table for Q = 32  with characteristic P = 2.
  GFTAB computing table for Q = 49  with characteristic P = 7.
