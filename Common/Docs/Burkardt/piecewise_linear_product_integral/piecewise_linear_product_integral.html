    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>PIECEWISE_LINEAR_PRODUCT_INTEGRAL</b>
      is which
      calculates the exact value of the integral of the product of two
      piecewise linear functions F(X) and G(X).
    </p>

    <p>
      The piecewise linear function F(X) is defined by
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>F_NUM</b>, the number of nodes;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>F_X</b>(1:F_NUM), the X coordinates of the nodes (in ascending order);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>F_V</b>(1:F_NUM), the value of F at each node;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The piecewise linear function G(X) is defined similarly, and there is
      no requirement that G(X) uses the same nodes as F(X), or the same number of nodes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The task, then, is to determine the value of
      <pre>
        Integral ( A <= X <= B ) F(X) * G(X) dx
      </pre>
      This value can be determined exactly, by breaking the interval ot integration
      into subintervals over which F(X) and G(X) are simple linear functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      In finite element programs over 1-dimensional geometries, integrals like
      this may occur when assembling the stiffness matrix, but these integrals
      are generally treated using quadrature.
    </p>

    <p>
      A more appropriate use for this function occurs when coarsening a finite
      element solution, or constructing a piecewise linear least squares
      finite element approximant to data that is regarded as a piecewise linear
      function.
    </p>

    <p>
      In case 1, we treat the original finite element solution as the function F(X),
      and in case 2, we treat the data as a finite element function whose mesh
      is implicit in the X coordinates of the given data.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our G_X is, in case 1, the coarse mesh and in case 2 the given mesh.
      To determine the finite element coefficient U(I) on this mesh, we
      must integrate our data function F(X) against the I-th basis function,
      which in this case is simply the I-th "hat function.  So to use
      our formula for G(X), we set G_V(1:G_NUM) to 0, except that G_V(I) = 1,
      and compute
      <pre>
        U(I) = Integral ( G_X(I-1) <= X <= G_X(I+1) ) F(X) * G(X) dx
      </pre>
      Doing this for I from 1 to G_NUM allows us to compute the coefficients
      of the coarsened solution (case 1) or the least squares approximant to
      the piecewise linear function representing the data F.
