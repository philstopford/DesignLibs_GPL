    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>POISSON_SIMULATION</b>
      is a C++ program which
      simulates a Poisson process in which events occur uniformly at random,
      with an average waiting time of Lambda, 
      creating output for graphics by gnuplot.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the Poisson distribution therefore also describes the
      distribution of distances from one point to the next, assuming the
      points are distributed uniformly at random along a line, with
      average density Lambda per unit length.
