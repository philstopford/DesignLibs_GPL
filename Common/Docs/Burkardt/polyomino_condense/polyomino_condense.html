      POLYOMINO_CONDENSE <br> Reflect and Rotate a Polyomino

    <p>
      <b>POLYOMINO_CONDENSE</b>,
      which
      cleans up a matrix that represents a polyomino by setting all nonzero
      entries to 1, and removing initial and final rows and columns of zeros.
    </p>

    <p>
      A polyomino is a shape formed by connecting unit squares edgewise.
    </p>

    <p>
      A polyomino can be represented by an MxN matrix, whose entries are
      1 for squares that are part of the polyomino, and 0 otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program is given an MxN matrix that is meant to represent a 
      polyomino.  It first replaces all nonzero entries by the value 1.
      It then "condenses" the matrix, if possible, by removing initial and
      final rows and columns that are entirely zero.
    </p>

    <p>
      While this procedure might save a slight amount of space, its purpose
      is to simplify the task of manipulating polyominos, embedding them in
      larger shapes, and detecting whether two polyominos describe the same
      shape.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is entirely possible, and usual, that the output quantities are
      simply copies of the input quantities.
