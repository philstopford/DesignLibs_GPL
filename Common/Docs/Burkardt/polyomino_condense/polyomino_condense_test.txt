POLYOMINO_CONDENSE_TEST:
  C version
  POLYOMINO_CONDENSE 'cleans up' a matrix that is supposed
  to represent a polyomino:
  * nonzero entries are set to 1;
  * initial and final zero rows and columns are deleted.

  The initial (3,3) polynomino P:

 0 1 0
 1 1 1
 1 0 0

  The condensed (3,3) polynomino Q:

 0 1 0
 1 1 1
 1 0 0

  The initial (3,3) polynomino P:

 0 1 0
 1 3 -9
 2 0 0

  The condensed (3,3) polynomino Q:

 0 1 0
 1 1 1
 1 0 0

  The initial (3,4) polynomino P:

 0 0 0 0
 0 1 0 0
 0 3 0 0

  The condensed (2,1) polynomino Q:

 1
 1

  The initial (2,4) polynomino P:

 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0

  The condensed (0,0) polynomino Q:

  [ Null matrix ]
