      POLYOMINO_EMBED <br> Embed a Polyomino in a Region
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>POLYOMINO_EMBED</b>,
      which
      is given matrices defining a region R and a polyomino P, and determines
      the number of possible embeddings of the polyomino into the region, and
      the translations necessary to achieve them.
    </p>

    <p>
      A region R is a subset of an MRxNR grid of squares.
    </p>

    <p>
      A polyomino P is a subset of an MPxNP grid of squares.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both objects are represented by binary matrices, with the property that
      there are no initial or final zero rows or columns.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this computation, we regard P as a "fixed" polyomino; in other words,
      no reflections or rotations will be allowed.
    </p>

    <p>
      An "embedding" of P into R is an offset (MI,NJ) such that 
<pre>
  P(I,J) = R(I+MI,J+NJ) 
  for 1 <=  I <=    MP, 1 <=  J <=    NP, and 
  for 0 <= MI <= MR-MP, 0 <= MJ <= NR-NP.
</pre>
      We can detect an embedding simply by taking what amounts to a kind of
      dot product of P with a corresponding subregion of R.
