    <p>
      <b>POLYOMINO_LP_WRITE</b>,
      a C++ program which
      writes an LP file describing a (binary) integer programming problem
      related to the tiling of a region R by copies of polyomino
      shapes, with possible reflections and rotations.
    </p>

    <p>
      LP files are a simple file format, used for linear programming problems
      and related cases.  They can be read by programs such as CPLEX, GUROBI,
      and SCIP.
