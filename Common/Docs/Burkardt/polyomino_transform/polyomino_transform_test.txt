POLYOMINO_TRANSFORM_TEST:
  POLYOMINO_TRANSFORM can transform a polyomino.
  Generate all 8 combinations of rotation and reflection
  applied to a polyomino represented by a binary matrix.

  The given polyomino P:

 0 1 1
 1 1 0
 0 1 0

  P after 0 reflections and 0 rotations:


 0 1 1
 1 1 0
 0 1 0

  P after 0 reflections and 1 rotations:


 1 0 0
 1 1 1
 0 1 0

  P after 0 reflections and 2 rotations:


 0 1 0
 0 1 1
 1 1 0

  P after 0 reflections and 3 rotations:


 0 1 0
 1 1 1
 0 0 1

  P after 1 reflections and 0 rotations:


 1 1 0
 0 1 1
 0 1 0

  P after 1 reflections and 1 rotations:


 0 1 0
 1 1 1
 1 0 0

  P after 1 reflections and 2 rotations:


 0 1 0
 1 1 0
 0 1 1

  P after 1 reflections and 3 rotations:


 0 0 1
 1 1 1
 0 1 0

POLYOMINO_TRANSFORM_TEST:
  Normal end of execution.
