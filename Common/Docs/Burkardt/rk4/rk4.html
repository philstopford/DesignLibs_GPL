      RK4 <br> Runge-Kutta 4th Order ODE Solver
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>RK4</b>
      is which
      implements a simple Runge-Kutta solver for an initial value problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rk4() function does not include any error estimator.  It
      takes a single step at a time, requiring the user to control the step size.
