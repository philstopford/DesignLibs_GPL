  C++ version

SGMG_SIZE_TESTS
  Call SGMG_SIZE_TEST with various arguments.

  All tests will use a point equality tolerance of -1

SGMG_SIZE_TEST
  SGMG_SIZE returns the number of distinct
  points in a multidimensional sparse grid with mixed factors.

  SGMG_SIZE_TOTAL returns the TOTAL number of
  points in a multidimensional sparse grid with mixed factors,
  without checking for duplication.

  Each sparse grid is of spatial dimension DIM_NUM,
  and is made up of product grids of levels up to LEVEL_MAX.
