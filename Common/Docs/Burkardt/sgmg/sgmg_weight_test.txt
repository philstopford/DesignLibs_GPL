SGMG_WEIGHT_PRB
  C++ version

SGMG_WEIGHT_TESTS
  Call SGMG_WEIGHT_TEST with various arguments.

  All tests will use a point equality tolerance of 0

SGMG_WEIGHT_TEST
  Compute the weights of a sparse grid.

  Each sparse grid is of spatial dimension DIM_NUM,
  and is made up of product grids of levels up to LEVEL_MAX.
