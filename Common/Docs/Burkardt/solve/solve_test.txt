SOLVE_PRB
  C++ version
  Test the SOLVE library.

TEST01
  Set up a linear system, and solve it by calling a function.
  The linear system is to be accessed using the A[i][j] notation.
  It is usually difficult to use this notation and still be able
  to pass the array A to a function.  An ordinary doubly indexed
  array would require the receiving function to know, IN ADVANCE,
  the exact fixed value of the second dimension of A, which defeats
  the goal of writing general usable library software.

  Here, I think I have made it easy, at the cost of:
  * declaring the array as a 'double **a'
  * creating the array with r8rmat_new() or r8rmat_zero()
  * solving the system with r8rmat_fs_new()
  * deleting the array with r8rmat_delete()

  Solution:

         0:              1
         1:              2
         2:              3

  Normal end of execution.
