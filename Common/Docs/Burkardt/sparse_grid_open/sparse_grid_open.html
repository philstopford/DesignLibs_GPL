    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SPARSE_GRID_OPEN</b>
      is which
      computes the location of points on a sparse grid
      based on an open quadrature rule.
    </p>

   <p>
      One way of looking at the construction of sparse grids is to assume
      that we start out by constructing a (very dense) product grid.
      We will assume for now that the <b>order</b>, that is, the number of
      points used in each component grid, is the same for all dimensions.
      Moreover, we will assume that the order is a power of 2 minus one,
      so that we have a natural relationship between the order and
      the logarithm base 2 of the order plus 1:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre><b>
        order = 2<sup>( level + 1 )</sup> - 1
      </b></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, if we allow <b>level</b> to grow, the <b>order</b> roughly
      doubles, as follows:
      <table border = "1">
        <tr><th>Level</th><th>Order</th></tr>
        <tr><td>    0</td><td>    1</th></tr>
        <tr><td>    1</td><td>    3</th></tr>
        <tr><td>    2</td><td>    7</th></tr>
        <tr><td>    3</td><td>   15</th></tr>
        <tr><td>    4</td><td>   31</th></tr>
        <tr><td>    5</td><td>   63</th></tr>
        <tr><td>    6</td><td>  127</th></tr>
        <tr><td>    7</td><td>  255</th></tr>
        <tr><td>    8</td><td>  511</th></tr>
        <tr><td>    9</td><td> 1023</th></tr>
        <tr><td>   10</td><td> 2047</th></tr>
      </table>
    </p>

    <p>
      To keep things simple, let us begin by supposing we are selecting
      points for a grid to be used in an interpolation or quadrature rule.
      If you successively compute the locations of the points of each
      level, you will probably see that the points of a level
      are all included in the grid associated with the next level.
      (This is not guaranteed for all rules; it's simply a property
      of the way most such grids are defined!).
    </p>

    <p>
      This <b>nesting</b> property is very useful.  For one thing,
      it means that when if we've computed a grid of one level, and now
      proceed to the next, then all the information associated with
      the current level (point location, the value of functions at those
      points) is still useful for the next level, and will save us
      some computation time as well.  This also means that, when we
      have reached a particular level, all the previous levels are
      still available to us, with no extra storage.  These considerations
      make it possible, for instance, to do efficient and convenient
      error estimation.
    </p>

    <p>
      When we move to a problem whose geometry is two-dimensional or
      more, we can still take the same approach.  However, when working
      in multidimensional geometry, it is usually not a good idea to
      form a grid using the product of 1D grids, especially when we
      are determining the order using the idea of levels.  Especially
      in this case, if we go to the next level in each dimension, the
      total number of points would increase by a factor of roughly
      2 to the spatial dimension.  Just a few such steps in, say,
      6 dimensions, and we would be far beyond our computational capacity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead, in multidimensions, the idea is to construct a <i>sparse
      grid</i>, which can be thought of in one of two ways:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the sparse gird is a logical sum of low order product grids;
          each product grid has a total level (sum of the levels of the
          1d rules) that is less than or equal to <b>level_max</b>;
        </li>
        <li>
          the sparse grid is a very sparse selection of points from the
          very high order product grid formed by using rules of level
          <b>level_max</b> in each dimension.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p><i>
      (There is still a lot of explaining to do to get from the one-dimensional
      levels to the N-dimensional levels and the selection of the low-level
      product grids that sum up to the sparse grid...)
    </i></p>

    <p>
      Once the grid indices of the sparse grid points have been selected,
      there are a variety of schemes for distributing the points.  We
      concentrate on two sets of schemes:
    <p>

    <p>
      Uniform (equally spaced) open rules of order N over [0,1]:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Newton Cotes Open: [ 1, 2, 3,..., N ] / ( N + 1 );<br>
          does not include boundaries.  Point spacing is 1/(N+1)<br>
          First and last points are distance 1/N to the boundary.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The uniform schemes are easy to understand.  However, it has
      been observed that greater accuracy and stability can be achieved
      by arranging the points in a nonuniform way that tends to move
      points towards the boundary and away from the center.
      A common scheme uses the cosine function to do this, and can
      be naturally derived from the uniform schemes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nonuniform open rules of order N over [-1,1]:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fejer Type 2:<br>
          Theta = pi * [ 1, 2, 3,..., N ] / ( N + 1 );<br>
          Points = cos ( theta );<br>
          does not include boundaries.<br>
          Analogue to the Newton Cotes Open Rule.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gauss-Patterson:<br>
          Starting with midpoint rule, then the Gauss rule of order 3,<br>
          incremented at each new level by intermediate points,<br>
          does not include boundaries.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that a standard Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule will not be suitable
      for use in constructing sparse grids, because rules of successively
      greater levels are not naturally nested.
