      SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH <br>
      Stereographic Mapping Between Sphere and Plane
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH</b>
      is a C++ program which
      implements the standard stereographic mapping between the unit sphere and
      the plane Z=1, as well as a generalization of this mapping.
    </p>

    <p>
      The stereographic projection preserves angles, and is a conformal mapping.
      This implies, for instance, that the Delaunay triangulation of a sphere
      maps to a corresponding Delaunay triangulation of the plane.
    </p>

    <p>
      Circles on the sphere that do not pass through the focus will be
      projected to circles on the plane.  Circles on the sphere that do pass
      through the focus will be projected to straight lines on the plane.
    </p>

      The Standard Projection
    </h3>

    <p>
      We start with a sphere of radius 1 and center <b>C</b> = (0,0,0).
    </p>

    <p>
      A plane is chosen, tangent to the sphere, at a point of tangency
      <b>T</b> which we take to be the "north pole", <b>T</b> = (0,0,1).
      We use a focus point <b>F</b>, which we take to be the "south pole",
      (0,0,-1)
    </p>

    <p>
      For any point <b>P</b> on the sphere, the stereographic projection <b>Q</b>
      of the point is defined by drawing the line from <b>F</b> through <b>P</b>,
      and computing <b>Q</b> as the intersection of this line with the plane.
    </p>

    <p>
      For any point <b>Q</b> on the plane, the stereographic inverse projection
      <b>P</b> of the point is defined by drawing the line from <b>F</b>
      through <b>Q</b>, and
      computing <b>P</b> as the intersection of this line with the sphere.
    </p>

    <p>
      The function <b>sphere_stereograph</b> carries out the standard projection,
      and <b>sphere_stereograph_inverse</b> does the inverse.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Projection with arbitrary center and focus
    </h3>

    <p>
      One way to generalize the projection is to allow the center <b>C</b> and
      focus point <b>F</b> to be arbitrary.  If we assume the point of tangency
      is antipodal to <b>F</b> then <b>T</b> = 2*<b>C</b>-<b>F</b>.  Once these
      points are defined, the stereographic projection relative to <b>F</b>,
      <b>C</b>, and <b>T</b> can be set up in the same way as before.
    </p>

    <p>
      The function <b>sphere_stereograph2</b> carries out the generalized
      projection, and <b>sphere_stereograph2_inverse</b> does the inverse.
