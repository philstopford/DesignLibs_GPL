SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH_PRB
  C++ version
  Test the SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH library.

TEST01
  SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH maps from sphere to plane.
  SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH_INVERSE is the inverse map.
  Check that these two functions are inverses.

  Map points from sphere to plane to sphere.
  RMS difference for 100 points was 4.52245e-17

  Map points from plane to sphere to plane.
  RMS difference for 100 points was 6.36729e-18

TEST02
  SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH standard mapping from sphere to plane.
  SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH2 generalized mapping:
  (focus and center are arbitrary)
  Check that these two functions can agree.

  Map points from sphere to plane.
  RMS difference for 100 points was 7.53339e-17

  Map points from plane to sphere.
  RMS difference for 100 points was 1.10505e-17

TEST03
  SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH2 maps from sphere to plane.
  SPHERE_STEREOGRAPH2_INVERSE is the inverse map.
  Check that these two functions are inverses.
