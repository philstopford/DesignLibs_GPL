STOCHASTIC_DIFFUSION_PRB
  C++ version
  Test the STOCHASTIC_DIFFUSION library.

BNT_CONTOUR
  Display contour or surface plots of the stochastic
  diffusivity function defined by DIFFUSIVITY_2D_BNT.

  The first plot uses uniform random values for OMEGA.
  The second uses Gaussian (normal) random values.

ELMAN_CONTOUR
  Display contour or surface plots of the stochastic
  diffusivity function defined by DIFFUSIVITY_2D_ELMAN.

NTW_CONTOUR
  Display contour or surface plots of the stochastic
  diffusivity function defined by DIFFUSIVITY_2D_NTW.

XK_CONTOUR
  Plot the stochastic diffusivity function
  defined by DIFFUSIVITY_1D_XK.
