STOCHASTIC_HEAT2D_PRB:
  C++ version
  Test the STOCHASTIC_HEAT2D library.

TEST01:
  Consider the steady heat equation in the unit square,
  with 0 Dirichlet boundary conditions, 
  and a heat source term F that is a Gaussian centered at (0.60,0.80).

  Model the diffusivity coefficient as spatially varying,
  with a stochastic dependence on parameters OMEGA(1:4),
  as described in Babuska, Nobile, Tempone (BNT).

  Compute and display the solution U for a given choice
  of the parameters OMEGA.

  Sampled OMEGA values:

         0:        3.35808
         1:      -0.945538
         2:       -1.13212
         3:      -0.462248

  Created graphics data file 'solution_data.txt'
  Created graphics command file 'solution_commands.txt'

  Mean value of U is 0.337698

TEST02:
  Fix OMEGA(3) = 4, OMEGA(4) = 0, and
  examine dependence of average temperature on OMEGA(1) and OMEGA(2)
  over the range [-10,+10].

  Omega(3) fixed at 4
  Omega(4) fixed at 0
