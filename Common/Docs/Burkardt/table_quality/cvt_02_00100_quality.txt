TABLE_QUALITY (C++ version):
  Compute measures of uniform dispersion for a pointset.

  Compiled on Jul  2 2005 at 14:18:37.

  Note: this routine assumes that the input pointset
  is contained in the unit hypercube.  If this is not
  the case, then you must rewrite the routine
    SAMPLE_ROUTINE
  so that it properly returns sample points in your
  region, with a uniform density, or a probability
  density of your choosing.

  Triangulated data generates 185 triangles.

  Measures of uniform point dispersion.

  The pointset was read from "cvt_02_00100.txt".
  The sample routine will be SAMPLE_HYPERCUBE_UNIFORM.
