TABLE_QUALITY (C++ version):
  Compute measures of uniform dispersion for a pointset.

  Compiled on Jun 23 2005 at 17:41:11.

  Note: this routine assumes that the input pointset
  is contained in the unit hypercube.  If this is not
  the case, then you must rewrite the routine
    SAMPLE_ROUTINE
  so that it properly returns sample points in your
  region, with a uniform density, or a probability
  density of your choosing.

  Measures of uniform point dispersion.

  The pointset was read from "cvt_07_00010.txt".
  The sample routine will be SAMPLE_HYPERCUBE_UNIFORM.

  Spatial dimension DIM_NUM =      7
  The number of points N =         10
  The number of sample points NS = 100000
  The random number SEED_INIT =    123456789

  The minimum angle measure    ALPHA = (omitted)
  The regularity measure         Chi = 3.26241
  2nd moment determinant measure   D = 1.48555e-14
  The Voronoi energy measure       E = 0.355249
  The mesh ratio               Gamma = 1.03713
  The point distribution norm      H = 1.0822
  The COV measure             Lambda = 0.0140941
  The point distribution ratio    Mu = 1.11241
  The cell volume deviation       Nu = 1.23651
  The triangle uniformity measure  Q = (omitted)
  The Riesz S = 0 energy measure  R0 = 0.346641
  Nonintersecting sphere volume    S = 0.00552582
  2nd moment trace measure       Tau = 0.0148465

TABLE_QUALITY:
  Normal end of execution.
