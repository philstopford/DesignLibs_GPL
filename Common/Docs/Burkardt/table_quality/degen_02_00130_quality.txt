TABLE_QUALITY (C++ version):
  Compute measures of uniform dispersion for a pointset.

  Compiled on Jun 23 2005 at 16:45:14.

  Note: this routine assumes that the input pointset
  is contained in the unit hypercube.  If this is not
  the case, then you must rewrite the routine
    SAMPLE_ROUTINE
  so that it properly returns sample points in your
  region, with a uniform density, or a probability
  density of your choosing.

  Triangulated data generates 233 triangles.

  Measures of uniform point dispersion.

  The pointset was read from "degen_02_00130.txt".
  The sample routine will be SAMPLE_HYPERCUBE_UNIFORM.

  Spatial dimension DIM_NUM =      2
  The number of points N =         130
  The number of sample points NS = 100000
  The random number SEED_INIT =    123456789

  The minimum angle measure    ALPHA = 0
  The regularity measure         Chi = 7.94406
  2nd moment determinant measure   D = 4.35832e-08
  The Voronoi energy measure       E = 0.00149741
  The mesh ratio               Gamma = 6.55522
  The point distribution norm      H = 0.0705486
  The COV measure             Lambda = 0.156217
  The point distribution ratio    Mu = 1.38611
  The cell volume deviation       Nu = 34.7097
  The triangle uniformity measure  Q = 0
  The Riesz S = 0 energy measure  R0 = 0.703656
  2nd moment trace measure       Tau = 0.00104408

TABLE_QUALITY:
  Normal end of execution.
