TABLE_QUALITY (C++ version):
  Compute measures of uniform dispersion for a pointset.

  Compiled on Jun 23 2005 at 16:45:14.

  Note: this routine assumes that the input pointset
  is contained in the unit hypercube.  If this is not
  the case, then you must rewrite the routine
    SAMPLE_ROUTINE
  so that it properly returns sample points in your
  region, with a uniform density, or a probability
  density of your choosing.

  Triangulated data generates 188 triangles.

  Measures of uniform point dispersion.

  The pointset was read from "halton_02_00100.txt".
  The sample routine will be SAMPLE_HYPERCUBE_UNIFORM.

  Spatial dimension DIM_NUM =      2
  The number of points N =         100
  The number of sample points NS = 100000
  The random number SEED_INIT =    123456789

  The minimum angle measure    ALPHA = 1.67374
  The regularity measure         Chi = 5.1746
  2nd moment determinant measure   D = 6.62849e-07
  The Voronoi energy measure       E = 0.0022173
  The mesh ratio               Gamma = 3.36968
  The point distribution norm      H = 0.124875
  The COV measure             Lambda = 0.288963
  The point distribution ratio    Mu = 2.31022
  The cell volume deviation       Nu = 5.39432
  The triangle uniformity measure  Q = 0.00186193
  The Riesz S = 0 energy measure  R0 = 0.778177
