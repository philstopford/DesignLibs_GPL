TOMS097_PRB
  C++ version
  Test the TOMS097 library.

I4MAT_SHORTEST_PATH_TEST
  I4MAT_SHORTEST_PATH uses Floyd''s algorithm to find the
  shortest distance between all pairs of nodes
  in a directed graph, starting from the initial array
  of direct node-to-node distances.

  In the initial direct distance array, if
    A(I,J) = HUGE,
  this indicates there is NO directed link from
  node I to node J.  In that case, the value of
  of A(I,J) is essentially 'infinity'.

  Initial direct-link distance matrix:

     0     2     5    -1    -1    -1
    -1     0     7     1    -1     8
    -1    -1     0     4    -1    -1
    -1    -1    -1     0     3    -1
    -1    -1     2    -1     0     3
    -1     5    -1     2     4     0

  In the final shortest distance array, if
    A(I,J) = -1,
  this indicates there is NO directed path from
  node I to node J.

  Final distance matrix:

     0     2     5     3     6     9
    -1     0     6     1     4     7
    -1    15     0     4     7    10
    -1    11     5     0     3     6
    -1     8     2     5     0     3
    -1     5     6     2     4     0
