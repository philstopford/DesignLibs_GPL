    <p>
      <b>TRIANGLE_TO_FEM</b>
      is a C++ program which
      reads a pair of node and element files created by the TRIANGLE program
      and writes a corresponding pair of node and element files that correspond
      to the FEM format.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>triangle_to_fem</b> <i>prefix</i>
      </blockquote>
      where <i>prefix</i> is the common filename prefix so that:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>.node</b> contains the coordinates of the nodes;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>.ele</b> contains the indices of nodes forming each 
          element.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>_nodes.txt</b> will be the FEM node file created by the program.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>_elements.txt</b> will be the FEM element file created by the program.
        </li>
      </ul>
