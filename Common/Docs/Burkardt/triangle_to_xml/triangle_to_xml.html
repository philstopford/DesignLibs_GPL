    <p>
      <b>TRIANGLE_TO_XML</b>
      is a C++ program which
      reads a pair of node and element files created by the TRIANGLE program
      and writes a corresponding XML mesh file that can be used by FENICS
      or DOLFIN.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>triangle_to_xml</b> <i>prefix</i>
      </blockquote>
      where <i>prefix</i> is the common filename prefix so that:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>.node</b> contains the coordinates of the nodes;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>.ele</b> contains the indices of nodes forming each element.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>.xml</b> will be the XML mesh file.
        </li>
      </ul>
