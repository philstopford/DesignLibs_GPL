      TRIANGULATION_BOUNDARY_NODES <br> Boundary Nodes of a Triangulation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TRIANGULATION_BOUNDARY_NODES</b>
      is a C++ program which
      analyzes the triangulation
      of a region, and lists those nodes which lie on the boundary
      of the triangulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Either a 3-node or 6-node triangulation may be used.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although this boundary information is useful, it would be more
      useful to divide the boundary nodes up, if the boundary consists
      of more than one connected segment.  Moreover, it would also be
      useful to report the sequence of nodes necessary to trace out
      a connected segment of the boundary.  I imagine I will come back
      to work on those projects later!
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>triangulation_boundary_nodes</b> <i>prefix</i>
      </blockquote>
      where 'prefix' is the common filename prefix:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>_nodes.txt</b> contains the node coordinates,
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>_elements.txt</b> contains the element definitions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>_boundary_nodes.txt</b> will contain a 0 for each internal
          node, and a 1 for each boundary node.
        </li>
      </ul>
