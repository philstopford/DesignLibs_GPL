      VANDERMONDE_APPROX_1D <br> Data Approximation with Polynomials using the Vandermonde Matrix
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>VANDERMONDE_APPROX_1D</b>
      is which
      finds a polynomial approximant to 1D data by setting up and
      solving an overdetermined linear system involving the Vandermonde matrix.
    </p>

    <p>
      This software is primarily intended as an illustration of the problems
      that can occur when the approximatino problem is naively formulated
      using the Vandermonde matrix.  Unless the data points are well separated,
      and the degree of the polynomial is low, the linear system will become
      very difficult to store and solve accurately, because the monomials
      used as basis vectors by the Vandermonde approach become indistinguishable.
    </p>

    <p>
      VANDERMONDE_APPROX_1D needs access to the QR_SOLVE and R8LIB libraries.
      The test code also needs access to the CONDITION and TEST_INTERP libraries.
