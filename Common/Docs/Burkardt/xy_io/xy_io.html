    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>XY_IO</b> 
      is which
      reads and writes files in the XY, XYL and XYF formats.
    </p>

    <p>
      XY files are a simple way of storing information about sets of points in 2D.
    </p>

    <p>
      An XY file has a simple structure.  There are three kinds of records:
      <ul>
        <li>
          COMMENT LINES begin with the character '#' and are ignored;
        </li>
        <li>
          BLANK LINES are ignored;
        </li>
        <li>
          COORDINATE LINES each contain one pair of X, Y coordinates;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is an example of an XY file containing 13 points:
      <pre>
#  house.xy
#
        0.000000        0.000000
        6.000000        0.000000
        6.000000        7.000000
        3.000000       10.000000
        0.000000        7.000000
        4.000000        1.000000
        5.000000        1.000000
        5.000000        4.000000
        4.000000        4.000000
        5.000000        8.000000
        5.000000       11.000000
        4.000000       11.000000
        4.000000        9.000000
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, in many cases, we would like to describe LINES between the points.
      We can add this information by including a second file, called an XYL file,
      which consists of a string of point indices.  A line is drawn from one point
      to the next and so on through each point listed on a record.  Thus, an XYL file
      associated with the above XY file might be:
      <pre>
#  house.xyl
#
 0 1 2 3 4 0
 5 6 7 8 5
 9 10 11 12
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      We might also like to describe FACES defined by the points.
      We can add this information by including a file, called an XYF file,
      which consists of a string of point indices.  A face is defined by
      listing in counterclockwise order the vertices that lie on it.
      The first vertex is not repeated
      as the final vertex. Thus, an XYF file
      associated with the above XY file might be:
      <pre>
#  house.xyf
#
 0 1 2 3 4
 5 6 7 8
 9 10 11 12
      </pre>
    </p>
