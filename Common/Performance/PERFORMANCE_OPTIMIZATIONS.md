## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Aggressive Inlining Strategy
Applied to methods that are:
- Small and frequently called
- In hot code paths (inner loops)
- Simple mathematical operations
- Data structure access methods

### 2. Memory Allocation Reduction Techniques

**ArrayPool Usage Pattern:**
```csharp
// Before: Creates GC pressure
T[] array = new T[size];

// After: Uses pooled memory
T[] array = ArrayPool<T>.Shared.Rent(size);
// ... use array ...
ArrayPool<T>.Shared.Return(array, clearArray);
```

**Span<T> Usage Pattern:**
```csharp
// Before: Array.Copy overhead
Array.Copy(source, destination, length);

// After: Optimized span copy
source.AsSpan(0, length).CopyTo(destination.AsSpan());
```

### 3. Branch Prediction Optimization

**Replaced Switch Expressions:**
```csharp
// Before: Potential branch misprediction
return value switch
{
    0 => handling_zero,
    _ => handling_nonzero
};

// After: Better branch prediction
if (value == 0)
    return handling_zero;
return handling_nonzero;
```

### 4. Mathematical Function Optimizations

**Power Function Optimization:**
```csharp
// Before: Generic Math.Pow for all cases
return Math.Pow(num, exp);

// After: Fast paths for common cases
return exp switch
{
    0 => 1.0,
    1 => num,
    2 => num * num,
    3 => num * num * num,
    // ... etc
};
```
