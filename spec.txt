1.0 Notes to the User


Stream format is the standard output format for GDSII data. Stream format
is the format written by OUTFORM and STREAMOUT and read by INFORM.
Libraries preserved in this format can be easily transferred to other sys-
tems for processing. Stream format is upward compatible between releases.
Libraries archived under an old release will always be readable by newer re-
leases. For this reason, libraries preserved in Stream format can be archived.

Sections 2 through 4 describe the Stream format components. Sections 5 and
6 describe the Stream syntax. Section 7 provides an example and description
of a Stream format file.

-------------------------------------------Record Description




2.0 Record Description


The Stream format output file is composed of variable length records. The
minimum record length is four bytes. Records can be infinitely long. The
first four bytes of a record are the header. The first two bytes of the header
contain a count (in eight-bit bytes) of the total record length. The count
tells you where one record ends and another begins. The next record begins
immediately after the last byte included in the count.

The third byte of the header is the record type. The fourth byte of the header
describes the type of data contained within the record. The fifth through last
bytes of a record are data. Figure 2-1 shows a typical record header.

                       Figure 2-1. Typical Record Header


If the output file is a magnetic tape, then the records of the library are
written out in 2048-byte physical blocks. Records may overlap physical block
boundaries; a record is not required to be wholly contained in a single physical
block.

A null word consists of two consecutive zero bytes. Use null words to fill the
space between

       •   the last record of a library and the end of its physical block, or

       •   the last record of a tape in a multi-reel Stream file and the end of
           its physical block.

Sections 3 and 4 describe data and record types. Section 5 shows how the
Stream records must be arranged.

The following paragraphs describe the data types listed in Table 3-1.

     Remember:         A word consists of 16 bits, numbered 0 to 15, left to
                       right.

       •   Bit Array (1):

           A bit array is a word which uses the value of a particular bit or
           group of bits to represent data. A bit array allows one word to
           represent a number of simple pieces of information.

       •   Four-Byte Real (4) and Eight-Byte Real (5):

           4-byte real = 2 word floating point representation

           8-byte real = 4 word floating point representation

           For all non-zero values:

                  •   A floating point number is made up of three parts: the
                      sign, the exponent, and the mantissa.

                  •   The value of a floating point number is defined to be:

                      (Mantissa) x (16 raised to the true value of the exponent
                      field).

                  •   The exponent field (bits 1-7) is in Excess-64 representa-
                      tion. The 7-bit field shows a number that is 64 greater
                      than the actual exponent.

                  •   The mantissa is always a positive fraction >=1/16 and
                      <1. For a 4-byte real, the mantissa is bits 8-31. For an
                      8-byte real, the mantissa is bits 8-63.

                  •   The binary point is just to the left of bit 8.

                  •   Bit 8 represents the value 1/2, bit 9 represents 1/4, etc.

                  •   In order to keep the mantissa in the range of 1/16 to
                      1, the results of floating point arithmetic are normal-
                      ized. Normalization is a process whereby the mantissa is
                      shifted left one hex digit at a time until its left FOUR bits
                      represent a non-zero quantity. For every hex digit shifted,
                      the exponent is decreased by one. Since the mantissa is
                      shifted four bits at a time, it is possible for the left three
                      bits of a normalized mantissa to be zero. A zero value,
                      also called true zero, is represented by a number with all
                      bits zero.

           Following are representations of 4-byte and 8-byte reals, where S is
           the sign, E is the exponent, and M is the magnitude. Examples of
           4-byte reals are included. The representation of the negative values
           of real numbers is exactly the same as the positive, except that the
           highest order bit is 1, not o.

           In the eight-byte real representation, the first four bytes are exactly
           the same as in the four-byte real representation. The last four bytes
           contain additional binary places for more resolution.

           4-byte real:

                 SEEEEEEE MMMMMMMM MMMMMMMM MMMMMMMM

           8-byte real:

               SEEEEEEE MMMMMMMM MMMMMMMM MMMMMMMM
               MMMMMMMM MMMMMMMM MMMMMMMM MMMMMMMM


           Examples of 4-byte real:


           Note:     In the first six lines of the following example, the 7-bit
                     exponent field = 65. The actual exponent is 65-64=1.

Records are always an even number of bytes long. If a character string is an
odd number of bytes long it is padded with a null character.

Following are records and a brief description of each, where the first two
numbers in brackets are the record type and the last two numbers in brackets
are the data type. All record numbers are expressed in hexidecimal.

2 LIBNAME                   ASCII String
[0206]
                            Contains a string which is the library name. The
                            library name must adhere to CDOS file name con-
                            ventions for length and valid characters. The li-
                            brary name may include the file extension (.DB in
                            most cases).


3 UNITS                     Eight-Byte Real
[0305]
                            Contains 2 8-byte real numbers. The first is the
                            size of a database unit in user units. The second is
                            the size of a database unit in meters. For example,
                            if your library was created with the default units
                            (user unit = 1 micron and 1000 database units per
                            user unit), then the first number would be .001 and
                            the second number would be 1E-9. Typically, the
                            first number is less than 1, since you use more than
                            1 database unit per user unit.

                            To calculate the size of a user unit in meters, divide
                            the second number by the first.

16 XY                       Four-Byte Signed Integer
[1003]
                            Contains an array of XY coordinates in database
                            units. Each X or Y coordinate is four bytes long.

                            Path and boundary elements may have up to 200
                            pairs of coordinates. A path must have at least 2,
                            and a boundary at least 4 pairs of coordinates. The
                            first and last point of a boundary must coincide.

                            A text or SREF element must have only one pair of
                            coordinates.

                            An AREF has exactly three pairs of coordinates,
                            which specify the orthogonal array lattice. In an
                            AREF the first point is the array reference point.
                            The second point locates a position which is dis-
                            placed from the reference point by the inter-column
                            spacing times the number of columns. The third
                            point locates a position which is displaced from the
                            reference point by the inter-row spacing times the
                            number of rows.

                            A node may have from 1 to 50 pairs of coordinates.

                            A box must have five pairs of coordinates with the
                            first and last points coinciding.

                            For an example of an array lattice, see Figure 4-2.

                            may be associated with anyone element: the total

                            attribute-value pairs, must not exceed 128 (or 512
                            if the element is an SREF, AREF, or node).

                            18 bytes. This is 6 bytes for "metal" (odd-length
                            strings must be padded with a null) + 8 for "prop-
                            erty" + 2 times the 2 attributes (4)= 18.

                               An Archive Stream file contains elements for all the
                               layers and data types. It is created with OUTFORM.
                               In an Archive Stream file, the FORMAT record is fol-
                               lowed immediately by the UNITS record. A file which
                               does not have the FORMAT record is assumed to be
                               an Archive file.

                               A Filtered Stream file contains only the elements
                               on the layers and with the data types specified by
                               the user during execution of STREAMOUT. The list
                               of layers and data types specified for STREAMOUT

                            follows the FORMAT record in MASK records. The MASK
                            records are terminated with the ENDMASKS record.
                            At least one MASK record must immediately follow
                            the FORMAT record. The Filtered Stream file is cre-
                            ated with STREAMOUT.

                            See MASK and ENDMASKS below.



55 MASK                     ASCII String. (Required for Filtered format, and
[3706]                      present only in Filtered Stream file.)

                            Contains the list of layers and data types specified
                            by the user for STREAMOUT. At least one MASK
                            record must follow the FORMAT record. More than
                            one MASK record may follow the FORMAT record. The
                            last MASK record is followed by the ENDMASKS record.

                            See FORMAT above and ENDMASKS below.

                            In the MASK list, data types are separated from the
                            layers with a semi-colon. Individual layers or data
                            types are separated with a space. A range of layers
                            or data types is specified with a dash. An example
                            MASK list looks like this:

                                  1 5-7 10 : 0-63



66 ENDMASKS                 No Data Present. (Required for Filtered format,
[3800]                      and present only in Filtered Stream file.)

                            Terminates the MASI( records. The ENDMASKS record
                            must follow the last MASK record. ENDMASKS is im-
                            mediately followed by the UNITS record.

                            See FORMAT and MASK above.

5.0 Stream Syntax


Following is a Bachus N aur representation of the Stream syntax. An element
shown in ALL CAPS is the name of an actual record type. An element shown
in lower case means that name can be further broken down into a set of
actual record types. Table 5-1 shows the meaning of the different symbols
used.

6.0 Multi-Reel Stream Format


You can put Stream format onto multiple reels of tape. The first tape Inust
end with the records TAPENUM, TAPECODE, and LIBNAME, in that order. Each
subsequent tape must begin with the same records, in the same order, and
must end with the record TAPENUM. Stream tapes must contain only complete
Stream records, i.e., no Stream record should begin on one tape and continue
on the next tape.


   Note:    Use TAPENUM and TAPECODE only as described. These records can-
            not appear anywhere else in the Stream file.


The records TAPENUM, TAPECODE, and LIBNAME, used in this manner, are used
only for identification of the tapes and are not incorporated into the library
in any way. LIBNAME occurs normally as the third record of a Stream file.
Tapes may end after any record in Stream format.

Following are illustrations of multi-reel Stream tapes.


Tape 1:

             I                     I            I                I

Following is a Bachus Naur representation of multi-reel Stream tapes. Refer
to Table 5-1 for an explanation of the symbols used.

<multi-reel Stream tape>::=               <tape1> {<continuation tapes>}+

<tape1>::=                                HEADER {<complete records in Stream
                                          syntax>}* <tape-id>

<continuation tapes>::=                   <tape-id> {<complete records continuing
                                          in Stream syntax>}+ TAPENUM

<tape-id>::=                              TAPENUM TAPECODE LIBNAME


The entire concatenation of Stream records, without the tape-id groups and
TAPENUMs, should conform to the Stream syntax described in Section 5.0.

            Figure 7-1. Sample Stream Format File (Page 2 of 2)



The database that produced this stream format output had only two struc-
tures. They were called EXAMPLEl and EXAMPLE2. EXAMPLE2 con-
tained only one element, a 2 x 2 AREF of EXAMPLEl. EXAMPLEl con-
tained a boundary that was template data, a path with two properties, and
a middle-center justified text element containing the string I AM HERE.

The records contained in this stream file are as follows:

0006 0002 0258

The first word says that this record is 6 bytes long. The second word says
that this is the HEADER record (00 hex), and that it contains data of type 2-
byte signed integer (02 hex). The information in the third word is the GDSII
version number, which in this case is version 600 (258 hex).

0000

This record is 28 (lC hex) bytes long. It is the BGNLIB (01 hex) record and it
contains data of type 2-byte signed integer (02). The 24 bytes of information
following the first two header words contain the modification and last access
date and time. The last 6 words of information, for example, contain: the
year - 85 (55 hex), the month - September (9 hex), the day - 3 (3 hex), the
hour - 10 a.m. (A hex), the minute - 16 (10 hex) and the seconds - o. All
together this record says that this library was last modified on September 3,
1985 at 10:16:00 a.m.

0006 3902 0028

This record is 6 bytes long. It is the LIBDIRSIZE (39 hex) record, and it con-
tains data of type 2-byte signed integer (02). In this example, the directory
size is 40 (28 hex) pages.

OOOA 3B02 0003 0005 0007

This record is 10 (A hex) bytes long. It is the LIBSECUR (3B hex) record and
it contains data of type 2-byte signed integer (02). In this example, there is
only 1 ACL entry. The entry has a group number of 3, a user number of 5,
and access rights of 7. This means that the only one with any access rights
to this library is user number 5 in group number 3. The access code (0007)
means this user has read and write access and is also the owner of the library.

OOOE 0206 4558 414D 504C 452E 4442

This record is 14 (E hex) bytes long. It is the LIBNAME (02 hex) record and it
contains data of type ASCII string (06). The 5 words of information contain
the library name EXAMPLE. DB.

This record is 92 (5C hex) bytes long. It is the REFLIBS (1F hex) record and
it contains data of type ASCII string (06). All 92 bytes of this record must
be present if there are any reference libraries bound to the working library.
In this example, the library GOSII: REF 1. DB is the bound reference library.
The library name is padded with nulls to equal 44 bytes. There is no second
reference library, so the last 44 bytes are filled with nulls.

OOOC 1C05 425A 0000 0000 0000

This record is 12 (C hex) bytes long. It is the ANGLE (1C hex) record and
it contains 8-byte real data (05). The data 425A 0000 0000 0000 represents
90.0, which implies that this AREF was placed at an angle of 90 degrees.

0008 1302 0002 0002

This record is 8 bytes long. It is the COLROW (13 hex) record and it contains
2-byte signed integer data (02). In this example, we have a 2 x 2 AREF.

4E20

This record is 28 (1C hex) bytes long. It is the XY (10 hex) record and it
contains data of type 4-byte signed integer (03). The data, taken 2 words at
a time, can be translated to decimal as: 20000, 20000, 20000, 86000, 80000,
20000. Multiply these numbers by 1 thousandth (because a data base unit is
1 thousandth of a user unit) and we get the coordinates: (20, 20), (20, 86),
and (80, 20). The first coordinate is the array reference point. The second
coordinate is a point which is displaced from the array reference point in the
Y-direction by the number of columns times the inter-column spacing. In this
example, the second point was displaced 66 (86 - 20) units from the array
reference point. Since there are 2 columns, this implies that the inter-column
spacing was 33 units. A similar calculation could be carried out to verify
that the inter-row spacing was 30 units.

0004 1100

This record is 4 bytes long. It is the ENDEL (11 hex) record and it contains
no data (00). It marks the end of an element.

0004 0100

This record is 4 bytes long. It is the ENDSTR (07 hex) record and it contains
no data (00). It marks the end of a structure.
